## Strategy Canvas

**Current State of Competition:**

```
VALUE
HIGH |
     |    *         *              *
     |         *         *    *
     |    *         *         *    *
     |         *         *
LOW  |____*____________________________
     | F1   F2   F3   F4   F5   F6   F7
                FACTORS

Legend:
* = Industry average
```

**Factors (F1-F7):**
- F1: {{Factor 1 - e.g., Price}}
- F2: {{Factor 2 - e.g., Features}}
- F3: {{Factor 3 - e.g., Ease of Use}}
- F4: {{Factor 4 - e.g., Support}}
- F5: {{Factor 5 - e.g., Integration}}
- F6: {{Factor 6 - e.g., Speed}}
- F7: {{Factor 7 - e.g., Customization}}

## Four Actions Framework (ERRC Grid)

### ELIMINATE
*What factors should be eliminated that the industry takes for granted?*

| Factor | Current Cost | Customer Value | Action |
|--------|--------------|----------------|--------|
| {{Factor 1}} | High/Med/Low | Low | Eliminate |
| {{Factor 2}} | High/Med/Low | Low | Eliminate |

**Rationale:** {{why these factors add cost but not value}}

---

### REDUCE
*What factors should be reduced well below industry standard?*

| Factor | Industry Level | Our Level | Savings |
|--------|----------------|-----------|---------|
| {{Factor 1}} | High | Medium | {{$X}} |
| {{Factor 2}} | High | Low | {{$X}} |

**Rationale:** {{why reducing these won't hurt value}}

---

### RAISE
*What factors should be raised well above industry standard?*

| Factor | Industry Level | Our Level | Investment |
|--------|----------------|-----------|------------|
| {{Factor 1}} | Medium | High | {{$X}} |
| {{Factor 2}} | Low | High | {{$X}} |

**Rationale:** {{why these create differentiated value}}

---

### CREATE
*What factors should be created that the industry has never offered?*

| New Factor | Customer Need | Competitor Gap | Opportunity Size |
|------------|---------------|----------------|------------------|
| {{Factor 1}} | {{need}} | None offer | ${{X}}M |
| {{Factor 2}} | {{need}} | None offer | ${{X}}M |

**Rationale:** {{why these create new value}}

---

## Non-Customer Analysis

### Three Tiers of Non-Customers

| Tier | Description | Size | Barrier | Opportunity |
|------|-------------|------|---------|-------------|
| **Tier 1** | Soon-to-be (on edge of market) | {{X}}% | {{barrier}} | {{opportunity}} |
| **Tier 2** | Refusing (chose against) | {{X}}% | {{barrier}} | {{opportunity}} |
| **Tier 3** | Unexplored (never considered) | {{X}}% | {{barrier}} | {{opportunity}} |

**Total Non-Customer Opportunity:** {{X}}× current market

## Blue Ocean Opportunities

| Opportunity | ERRC Action | Market Size | Feasibility | Priority |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| {{Opp 1}} | {{Create/Raise}} | ${{X}}M | H/M/L | 1 |
| {{Opp 2}} | {{Create/Raise}} | ${{X}}M | H/M/L | 2 |
| {{Opp 3}} | {{Eliminate/Reduce}} | Cost save | H/M/L | 3 |

## Strategic Recommendation

### If Red Ocean (Score > 4):
- **Strategy:** Differentiation through {{specific approach}}
- **Focus:** {{specific segment}} where competition is weaker
- **Avoid:** Price wars, feature matching

### If Blue Ocean (Score > 4):
- **Strategy:** Value innovation through {{ERRC combination}}
- **Focus:** {{non-customer tier}} conversion
- **Avoid:** Conventional competition, industry benchmarking

### If Mixed (Both ~3):
- **Strategy:** Hybrid approach
- **Short-term:** Compete in {{red areas}}
- **Long-term:** Develop {{blue opportunities}}
